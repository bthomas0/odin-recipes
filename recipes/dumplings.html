    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These boiled drop dumplings, which are popular in the U.S., are often paired with chicken and broth to create a popular comfort food called chicken and dumplings.</p>

    <p>They're prepared by dropping spoonfuls of dough into a pot of boiling soup or stew. The starch in the dumplings thickens the broth, resulting in a rich stew that's impossible to resist.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon margarine</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Cut in butter until mixture is crumbly. Stir in milk and mix until a batter forms that is thick enough to be scooped with a spoon. Allow batter to rest for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drop batter by spoonfuls into boiling stew or soup. Cover and simmer without lifting the lid for 15 minutes. Serve.</li>
    </ol>
